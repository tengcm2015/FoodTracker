# Save and Load the Meal

To be able to encode and decode itself and its properties, the `Meal` class needs to conform to the `NSCoding` protocol. To conform to `NSCoding`, the Meal needs to subclass `NSObject`.

The `NSCoding` protocol declares two methods that any class that adopts to it must implement so that instances of that class can be encoded and decoded:

```swift
encode(with aCoder: NSCoder)
init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder)
```

```swift
func encode(with aCoder: NSCoder) {
    aCoder.encode(name, forKey: PropertyKey.name)
    aCoder.encode(photo, forKey: PropertyKey.photo)
    aCoder.encode(rating, forKey: PropertyKey.rating)
}
```

```swift
required convenience init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
    // The name is required. If we cannot decode a name string, the initializer should fail.
    guard let name = aDecoder.decodeObject(forKey: PropertyKey.name) as? String else {
        os_log("Unable to decode the name for a Meal object.", log: OSLog.default, type: .debug)
        return nil
    }

    // Because photo is an optional property of Meal, just use conditional cast.
    let photo = aDecoder.decodeObject(forKey: PropertyKey.photo) as? UIImage

    let rating = aDecoder.decodeInteger(forKey: PropertyKey.rating)

    // Must call designated initializer.
    self.init(name: name, photo: photo, rating: rating)

}
```
The `required` modifier means this initializer must be implemented on every subclass, if the subclass defines its own initializers.
The `convenience` modifier means that this is a secondary initializer, and that it must call a designated initializer from the same class.
The question mark (`?`) means that this is a failable initializer that might return nil.

The `decodeObject(forKey:)` method decodes encoded information.
The return value of `decodeObjectForKey(_:)` is an `Any?` optional. The guard statement both unwraps the optional and downcasts the enclosed type to a `String`, before assigning it to the `name` constant. If either of these operations fail, the entire initializer fails.

```swift
//MARK: Archiving Paths

static let DocumentsDirectory = FileManager().urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first!
static let ArchiveURL = DocumentsDirectory.appendingPathComponent("meals")
```
the `static` keyword means the same as is in Java. Outside of the Meal class, you’ll access the path using the syntax Meal.ArchiveURL.path.
The `DocumentsDirectory` constant uses the file manager’s `urls(for:in:)` method to look up the URL for your app’s documents directory. This is a directory where your app can save data for the user. This method returns an array of URLs, and the first parameter returns an optional containing the first URL in the array. However, as long as the enumerations are correct, the returned array should always contain exactly one match. Therefore, it’s safe to force unwrap the optional.
After determining the URL for the documents directory, you use this URL to create the URL for your apps data. Here, you create the file URL by appending `meals` to the end of the documents URL.

# Save and Load the Meal List
* MealTableViewController.swift
    * call `saveMeals()` at:
        * `unwindToMealList(sender:)`
        * `tableView(_:commit:forRowAt:)`
    * `loadMeals()`
        * `viewDidLoad()`

```swift
private func saveMeals() {
    let isSuccessfulSave = NSKeyedArchiver.archiveRootObject(meals, toFile: Meal.ArchiveURL.path)
    if isSuccessfulSave {
        os_log("Meals successfully saved.", log: OSLog.default, type: .debug)
    } else {
        os_log("Failed to save meals...", log: OSLog.default, type: .error)
    }
}

private func loadMeals() -> [Meal]?  {
    return NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObject(withFile: Meal.ArchiveURL.path) as? [Meal]
}
```
